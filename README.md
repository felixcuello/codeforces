# Competitive Programming

## CodeForces

### Introduction

This is just a CodeForces competitive programming directory. Where we're going to code all our things. To avoid problems running in computers we have created a few things. Basically you need to create the `.in` and `.out` problems and run:

#### Ruby

`xxxx` is your problem code or whatever filename you put to your `xxxx.rb`, `xxxx.in` and `xxxx.out`

``` sh
make ruby PRG=xxxx
```


#### C++

`xxxx` is your problem code or whatever filename you put to your `xxxx.rb`, `xxxx.in` and `xxxx.out`

``` sh
make cpp PRG=xxxx
```


#### After you solved it:

``` sh
make solve PRG=xxxx
```

#### Clean up the mess

``` sh
make clean PRG=xxxx
```
